  <h1>Hello, I'm Arttu</h1>

  <p>
    In my current role as a developer I adapt to a wide range of situations
    deeply in the <em>client interface</em>, balancing technical expertise with
    customer-facing responsibilities in the field of eCommerce.
  </p>
  <p>
    In autumn 2025, I’ll begin a Master's in Educational Technology at the
    University of Jyväskylä, while continuing to work full-time in development.

    This portfolio is a home for ongoing work, experiments, and ideas — things that don’t always fit inside a case study or a résumé.
