    The other pages cover the usual — work, skills, projects. This one is a bit
    different. A look at who’s behind the screen.
  </p>

  <h2>🎧 Hobbies & Interests</h2>

  <p>
    I collect hobbies. Lately I've been learning to DJ — started in March 2025.
    Still very much in the beginner zone, but I’ve already fallen into building
    a focused DnB and psytrance library. It’s an easy way to find flow.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the summer I like to go magnet fishing. Low effort, weirdly satisfying.
    Feels like a treasure hunt, especially with friends.
  </p>

  <p>
    I read books, watch movies and shows — mostly sci-fi, thrillers, anime. I
    used to play guitar more often; it still comes out now and then.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hiking, puzzles, jogging — the list goes on. I won’t pretend I do them all
    regularly, but they’re all there.
  </p>

  <h2>🧠 Tech & Tinkering</h2>

  <p>
    I started coding early — when websites still used table layouts and blinking
    text. First projects were in pure HTML and CSS, and I built little games
    with CoolBasic. None of them survived. I kind of wish they did.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm into tech history: things like “why VHS beat Betamax” or “what killed
    Symbian”. I think those stories tell a lot about how humans, systems and
    decisions mix.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've messed around with different OSes, run a home Linux server, and started
    countless side projects. Many based on a joke. Most unfinished. Fun while
    they lasted.
  </p>

  <h2>🧭 What I Value</h2>

  <p>
    I like figuring things out — in tech, people, systems, stories. I like weird
    ideas, and I think the best way to learn is by trying things out.
  </p>

  <p>
    I admire people who are genuinely into things. Doesn’t matter what: jazz,
    insects, obscure programming languages. Passion is cool.
