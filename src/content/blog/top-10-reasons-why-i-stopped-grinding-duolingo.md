After a 628-day streak, I finally stopped using Duolingo. If you've read my earlier post about spending a full year learning Norwegian on the app ([365 Days of Learning Norwegian on Duolingo](https://arttu.net/blog/365-days-of-learning-norwegian-on-duolingo/)), this might come as a surprise. But after nearly two years of daily practice, I reached a point where continuing no longer made sense. Here's why.

## 1. I Was Buying Time With Streak Freezes

For the past month or so, I wasn’t really learning. I was burning through my reserve of gems just to keep my streak alive. That’s not language learning, that’s just digital hoarding.

## 2. It Stopped Being Fun

What started as a light, gamified way to practice began to feel like a chore. I’d open the app out of obligation, not curiosity. That’s never a good sign.

## 3. It Became a Daily Obligation I Didn't Need

I’ve been consciously trying to eliminate unnecessary obligations from my life. Duolingo started to feel like one of those things I could live without.

## 4. Learning Plateaued

I wasn’t learning enough anymore, at least not from Duolingo alone. My free time is limited, and I couldn't justify investing more of it into a tool that no longer matched my learning needs - especially for a language I may not use often or ever.

## 5. The Developer Choices Felt Off

When Duolingo laid off contract workers and replaced them with AI-generated content ([source](https://fortune.com/article/duolingo-ceo-says-getting-rid-of-contract-employees-replacing-them-with-ai/)), it left a bad taste in my mouth. It felt like a step away from quality, not toward it.

## 6. Too Much Super Duolingo Pressure

I felt increasingly pushed toward subscribing to Super Duolingo. Ads were everywhere. The free version started to feel like a funnel rather than a functional learning tool.

## 7. Inconsistent Challenge Levels

Some exercises were insultingly easy, others unreasonably hard. The pacing and difficulty curve didn’t make for an effective learning experience.

## 8. The Streak Lost Its Meaning

At the end of the day, a 628-day streak is just pixels on a screen. It doesn’t reflect my actual grasp of the language. It’s a vanity metric and I’m done chasing it.

## 9. The Gamification Got Stale

I genuinely liked the gamified elements of Duolingo. But gamification only works if it complements the learning. A five-minute, ad-filled session that repeats itself doesn’t help me move forward.

## 10. Quality Has Declined

Maybe I’m just pickier now, but it feels like the overall quality of the lessons has dropped since I started. And Duolingo still hasn’t fixed basic issues like not recognizing spoken numbers in Norwegian. That’s been broken the whole time I’ve been using it.

I’m not saying Duolingo is useless: it helped me build a foundation in Norwegian, and for that I’m thankful. But as a long-term solution for language learning? It’s not for me anymore.
