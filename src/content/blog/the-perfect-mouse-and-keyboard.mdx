## The Problem: Too Many Devices, Too Many Keyboards

For the past year, I've had a daily annoyance: switching between multiple computers with different peripherals. I use a MacBook Pro (M1) for work, a MacBook Air (M3) for personal use, and a Windows 11 desktop for gaming. Each had its own keyboard and mouse—Apple's Magic Mouse and keyboard for the Macs, and a separate set for the Windows machine.

## The Hassle of Switching Between Mac and Windows

Switching between the Apple ones meant unpairing and repairing devices every morning and evening. It was slow and frustrating. And with different set for PC, it cluttered my desk with two mice and two keyboards.

I decided enough was enough. My goal: find a keyboard and mouse that could easily switch between all three machines. I briefly considered a mechanical keyboard, but then I discovered the Logitech MX Keys Mini and MX Master 3S. Both allow seamless switching between up to three devices—just a button press away. Some colleagues recommended them too. I even considered buying Apple’s standalone trackpad since I loved the three-finger swipe gestures on macOS. But that wouldn’t have solved the bigger problem—I'd still need a separate mouse for Windows.

## The Fix: Logitech MX Keys Mini + Master 3S

I ordered the white versions from [Proshop](https://proshop.fi): the keyboard was €71.27, the mouse €86.73. They match my desk, speakers, and laptop nicely. If you're curious about my full setup, check out this blog post: [LINK TO DESK SETUP POST].

One blog post sealed the deal for me: [https://hulry.com/logitech-mx-master-3-review](https://hulry.com/logitech-mx-master-3-review). It reassured me that I wouldn't lose the speed of my current workflow. I’m a huge fan of macOS’s three-finger swipes for switching desktops and managing windows quickly.

## Key Takeaways

- Switching between Mac and Windows is seamless with MX Keys Mini and Master 3S
- Logi Options+ software adds even more flexibility, like cross-device copy-paste
- The keyboard feels premium and quiet, great for both dev work and writing
- If you have more than one computer, this setup is worth the investment

## The Outcome After One Month

So, how do they feel? Amazing. The MX Keys Mini is crisp and quiet—almost identical to the MacBook’s keyboard. I don’t miss the clacky mechanical keyboard I had on PC or the Apple keyboard one bit. The MX Master 3S is excellent too. With a thumb button to reveal windows and a side scroll wheel, I don’t miss Apple’s Magic Mouse or the SteelSeries Rival 710 (seriously, who needs a screen on a mouse?).

Best of all, switching between devices is now instant. No more Bluetooth drama. When I consider how much time and stress this saves me each day, the ~€150 total feels more than worth it.

Bonus: Logitech’s Logi Options+ software even allows copy-pasting across devices. I haven’t tried that yet, but it sounds incredibly promising.

Gaming? Works fine for me. I mostly play RTS and strategy games these days. It might not suit hardcore FPS players, but for casual gaming, it’s solid.

Some people complain the mouse looks ugly. I actually like its design—and anyway, it sits under your palm, not on display. Others say the keyboard replaces “important” keys with device-switching buttons. But honestly, I never used those keys before, and my workflow hasn’t suffered at all—in fact, it’s faster.

After a month of daily use, I couldn't be happier. No regrets. No complaints. Highly recommended.

## What’s Next?

I might dig deeper into Logi Options+ and how it fits into my development workflow. And I’m curious how this setup holds up over the next 6–12 months — maybe I’ll do a follow-up.
